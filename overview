Sense Overview
==========================================

## What is a channel?
A data Channel is a source of data that flows into the Sense platform. For example, a Channel could include all 
iOS devices with an app that uses the Sense Reach iOS SDK. Channels are collections of mobile apps that use the 
Sense SDKs, or of any other devices that write to the Sense Ingress API.

## How do devices connect to a channel?
Device sensor data is ingested into Sense 2.0 through the [Ingress API](http://docs.sixgill.com/ingress-api.html). 
For Android and iOS devices, this can be done by integrating the Sense SDK into a mobile app. 
The SDK handles sensor gathering at configurable intervals, and automatically sends the data to the Ingress API. 
The SDKs are authenticated using the API keys for their respective channels.
