# Schemas

Device data needs to be mapped to fields so you can trigger rules and view analytics. 
This is done using Schemas. Mobile devices (iOS, Android) have predefined schemas that you can use with our SDK a

For IoT devices you need to first create a custom schema. You can send any kind of data with IoT devices.
