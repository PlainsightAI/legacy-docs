Schemas

Device data needs to be mapped to fields so you can trigger rules and view analytics. 
This is done using Schemas. Mobile devices (iOS, Android) have predefined schemas that you can use with our SDK a
nd you donâ€™t need to configure them.

For IoT devices you need to first create a custom schema. You can send any kind of data with IoT devices.
It is recommended that you generate IoT schema based on your event payload. 
Once your schema is defined you can use it in a Channel and see data being ingested. Y
ou can update a schema if necessary at a later time.
